Package %{scl_name} provides MariaDB 5.5 database delivered using Software
Collections technology. For more information about Software Collections
concept, read scl(1). By installing %{scl_name} collection, you will get
the minimum working set of packages to have working MariaDB server.

%if 0%{rhel} >= 7
Usage: systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}mysqld
%else
Usage: service %{?scl_prefix}mysqld start
%endif

Software Collections concept allows to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy but are present
in an alternative location, which is %{scl_prefix}
in case of %{scl_name} collection.

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It is a
client/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld)
and many different client programs and libraries. This package contains
the MariaDB server and some accompanying files and directories.
MariaDB is a community developed branch of MySQL.

When working with %{scl_name} collection, use scl utility (see scl(1)
for usage) to enable scl environment properly. The only exception is
starting/stopping %{?scl_prefix}mysqld daemon, where scl environment
is enabled implicitely within the SysV init script or systemd unit file.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located under
%{_sysconfdir}

MariaDB server listens on network soket (by default port 3306) and unix socket
(by default /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock).

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with argument --arg within %{scl_name} software collections
  environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'mysql -u root -p'
  Run mysql shell from %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run interactive shell where %{scl_name} software collection is enabled.

%if 0%{rhel} >= 7
systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}mysqld 
%else
service %{?scl_prefix}mysqld start
%endif
    Starts the MariaDB server from %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man mysql'
  Show man pages for mysql command, which is part of the %{scl_name} software
  collection.

Files:
{_scl_scripts}/service-environment
Define which software collections should be enabled for the daemon process.
